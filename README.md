Original aim was to provide a list of plants suitable to the climate of the selected region and it's climate conditions. 

It was a project to practice upon building an interactive website using only HTML, CSS, Javascript (through Node). 
Currently it only holds a few plants, providing made up information and no real usage. The base goal of the app (communication between scripts, data fetching etc.) has been achieved. May work on it in the future to possibly be of real use to someone.
